a = "we t of the other things about this is that my eye, I'm just coming back to UCSD and the whole procedure takes a long time. We startent, please interpreted as an unintentional statement, but there's nothing like telling a joke in front of hundreds of people, especially once you ngs about you. And the survey will get even more. We'll do some analysis on that and presented. All the data that we take from survesources, handouts and readings. Data Hub will be where you do your assignments and they're going to be collected automatically. Piazza is for questions, discussion and regrade requests and canvases for grades and like, I guess lecture videos, the podcasts might be there. They're also on the Internet. I have a link also for anonymous feedback. So you guys can give us feedback as we go and we'll try to adapt. If you can't hear me or if I walk back and forth too much or something, that's useful, useful feedback that's kinda be respectful, not Dr. Sim Qin's is LeMay. That wouldn't be That's an old movie now I guess you didn't get that right. Okay. So look up LeMay when you go home and then you'll chuckle to yourself, slightly. General grading. Some of these slides are sort of hard to do without showing them to you in a little bit of a pain for me to present this way. I'm sorry. Okay. What you really need to know is this, there will be weekly quizzes on the lecture content. They won't be that hard. If you've listened to the podcasts or come to lecture, you'll be fine. It's just to make sure that you're listening to the material, even if you know it already that you hear what we say. We've tried not doing it that way apparently in the past doesn't work out well. So there are nine quizzes. One of them is going to be dropped. Discussion labs. There'll be these discussion labs that you're going to do. And one of one every week in discussion. Or you can do them on your own if you're comfortable. One of them will be dropped. That's the first one is eight per cent of your grade. That's 16%. Assignments. For assignments, 32%. Those are going to come. Not this. Then there's the final group project. The final group project is broken up into a project planning survey, project review proposal, checkpoints, final report, a final video, and a project survey. You don't need all the I can tell you the points breakdown now. But I saw somebody you just go like this. So I don't think I'm going to do attendance. It's not required. The lectures are recorded. Like I said, there'll be available. I'm told by 02:00 P.M. each day, Tuesday, Thursday after the lecture's Canvas Media Gallery. There'll be one of the discussion sections recorded. We haven't decided which one yet. And so you'll be able to, it's unnecessary to record all of them. So this way, you'll be able to listen to them, those to the quizzes. I just explained to you. Because I was going around the slides. I guess you want to know they're taken on Canvas. You have one attempt. About ten questions. It's timed, posted by Friday at midnight after each week of lecture, and it'll be due a week later, a midnight. It's automatically collected from previous research. Questions on that. It's so exciting. You guys have so excited. Like there are a few people jumping. Yeah. Okay. The slides that you be able to look back on, can you can look week-by-week, when's the quiz and when are the assignments? And unless I don't need to say that right now, I think that's unnecessary. What time is it? I looked down and I looked back and it said 1012 both times. That's not good. Oh,"
