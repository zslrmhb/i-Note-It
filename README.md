## Latest Features 
- Convert textual input, such as lecture transcripts and literature, into **streamlined** and **hierarchical** markdown formatted note.
- The note generation performs best with English lecture transcripts that *start* and *end* with **complete** word.
  - Other textual content, such as emoji, math formulas and programming language(especially **Python**) are supported.
  - Language other than English is supported.
    - Languages Tested: English, Chinese

- Able to **download** the markdown file of the formatted note.
- A **chatbot** that can answer detailed inquiry related to the input.
  - This is really useful when the user want to have a deeper understanding of the material. 
    - For example, the user can input the class lecture transcript and generate the note. The user is then able to ask question related to the class lecture that is inputted.

## How to use?



### Web Streamlit Demo
[Web Demo](https://zslrmhb-i-note-it-streamlit--scriptsmain-yj2vod.streamlit.app/)

### Local Streamlit Demo

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 - 3.10 
  - The demo uses Python 3.9
- Streamlit: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit
- st-chat: https://github.com/AI-Yash/st-chat
- API Key from AI21 Studio: https://docs.ai21.com/

#### Steps
> NOTE BEFORE PROCEEDING: If you want to have a local version of the demo, you will need a custom-train Jurassic-1 Grande Model. For more information in obtaining your own model, feel Free to reach out in the **Discussions** or **Issues** sections for a more detail.

##### Environment Configuration

###### Recommended (For Win64 Platform Only, Unfortunately)
1. Clone this Github Repository
2. Follow the instruction in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to initialize the conda environment

###### Alternative
1. Install the packages listed in the prerequisite (suggest using Anaconda to manage the environment) 

##### config.py
- As you may or may not notice, the program requires a config.py and we did not included it for the purpose of not sharing the API token. 
- You are going to set it up in your local environment, here is how:
  1. Once you have done all the steps above(Configured the environment), go to your cloned repository.
  2. Navigate into the **scripts** folder of the cloned repository.
  3. create a **config.py** file with content in the following format
  ```PYTHON
  API_TOKEN = ""       
  NOTETAKER_MODEL_URL = ""
  NOTEBOT_MODEL_URL = ""
  ```
    - API_TOKEN: Your AI21 Studio API KEY
    - NOTETAKER_MODEL_URL = The URL of your customized note generation model
    - NOTEBOT_MODEL_URL = The URL of your chatbot model
      - ex
        ```PYTHON
        NOTEBOT_MODEL_URL = "https://api.ai21.com/studio/v1/j1-jumbo/complete"
        ```


## Behind the Scene

### Language Model
#### Note Generation


##### Original Approach
- Prompt Engineering (Jurassic-1 Grande Model)
  - Zero-Shot Prompt
    - Simply asking the model to generate note without providing examples 
    - Worse Performance, give illogical and inconsistent outputs
  - Few-Shots Prompt
    - Asking the model to generate note by providing it with few examples
    - Better than the zero-shot prompt, but have a higher latency
##### Final Approach
- AI21 Lab Customized Jurassic-1 Grande Model 
  - Trained a customized note generation model on the top of Jurassic-1 Grande
  - Training data comes from video transcripts from various platform such as Canvas, Youtubeï¼ŒTED Talks and Coursera covering various domains/subjects. In addition, English literature such as passage from William Shakespeare are included in the training data
    - Feel Free to reach out, such as in the **Discussions** or **Issues** for a more detail explanation of the training process
  - Overall better performance and lower latency from the original approach

#### "Hyperparameter" Tuning
- Tuned the temperature and max-token of the model to optimize for best note generation result

#### Chatbot
- AI21 Lab Jurassic-1 Jumbo Model
  - Use 3 instructions as prompt, see [notebot.py](scripts/notebot.py)
  - Feed the input transcript as the *Context* for the Question *Inquiry*

### UI and Logo Design

#### UI
- Use Streamlit for the demo User Interface
  - Have the main functionality(note generation) presented as 2 columns (input and output) 
  - Put the chatbot in an expander for optional use, so it will not take up the majority of the space for the note display

#### Logo
- Took the first letter of each word of   "i-Note-lt"

### Future Plans and Improvements
- Domain-Specific Note Generation
- Accept larger input size for note generation
  - Slice the input into chunks to make note generation more efficient
- Accept input other than text for note generation
  - Audio
  - Video 
  - Web URL
  - ...
- User-Specific Note-Taking Model
- Multiple Platform
- And much more!!!
